# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Make post-publish verification tolerate brief npm registry propagation delays and prevent a user-level `allow-scripts` policy from breaking the isolated install smoke test.

## 0.2.0

- Add automatic TUI-only previews for image blocks already attached to user messages and tool results in supported tmux sessions; metadata rehydrates from the original branch message without duplicating image bytes.
- Add a dry-run-by-default guarded command for future stable releases.

## 0.1.0

- Initial public release of `pi-tmux-images`: TUI-only local `/image` previews for Pi that use Kitty placeholders safely under tmux.
